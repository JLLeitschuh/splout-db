<h3>Ready for the web</h3>
<p>
Splout allows serving an <strong>arbitrarily big dataset</strong> with <strong>high QPS rates</strong> and at the same time provides <strong>full SQL</strong> query syntax.
Splout is appropriated for web page serving, many <strong>low latency lookups</strong>, scenarios such as mobile or web applications with demanding performance.</p>

<h3>Plays well with Hadoop</h3>
Splout uses <a href='http://pangool.net'>Pangool</a> for <strong>decoupling database creation</strong> from database serving. The data is always <strong>optimally indexed</strong> and evenly distributed among partitions, plus updating all the data at once doesnâ€™t affect the serving of the datasets.
</div>

<div class="span4">
<h3>Scalable</h3>
Splout is <strong>horizontally scalable</strong>. You can increase throughput linearly by just adding more machines.
Splout is <strong>replicated for failover</strong>. Splout transparently replicates your dataset for properly handling failover scenarios such as network splits or hardware corruption.
