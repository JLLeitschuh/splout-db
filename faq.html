</div>

<dl>
  <dt>What's the difference between Splout SQL and Dremel-like solutions such as BigQuery, Impala or
    Apache Drill?
  </dt>
  <dd>Splout SQL is not a "fast analytics" Dremel-like engine. It is more thought to be used for serving
    datasets under web / mobile high-throughput, many lookups, low-latency applications. Splout SQL is
    more like a NoSQL database in the sense that it has been thought for answering queries under
    sub-second latencies. It has been thought for performing queries that impact a very small subset of
    the data, not queries that analyze the whole dataset at once.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Is it really so fast?</dt>
  <dd>Splout SQL is as fast as SQLite can be. The very good thing about Splout SQL is that, because it is
    a read-only store and data is replaced entirely every time, it always has the data optimally indexed,
    there is zero fragmentation and data colocation in disk can be controlled using sorting in the Hadoop
    indexer process (insertionOrderBy). As an example, we have used data colocation techniques within
    Splout SQL to obtain < 50ms average query time with 10 threads on dynamic GROUP BY's that hit an
    average of 2000 records each in a multi-gigabyte database that exceeded available RAM in orders of
    magnitude in a m1.small EC2 machine.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Can a DNode use more than one disk for storing data?</dt>
  <dd>Currently a DNode's working directory is fixed to be in a single disk location, however, there is
    nothing that prevents you from installing two DNode services in the same machine, as long as you
    configure everything properly so that they bind to different ports, for example.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>Can I execute INSERTs / UPDATEs on Splout SQL?</dt>
  <dd>There is nothing that will block or prevent you from executing INSERT / UPDATE statements through
    Splout SQL's interface. However, it is not the way you are supposed to use it. Splout SQL has been
    conceived to be a read-only store, and its data can be updated entirely by an atomic deploy
    mechanism, meaning that the whole dataset is replaced by another version of it. This fits well into
    batch-processing since usually you will have a new copy of the whole dataset each time you run your
    batch process, for example in Hadoop. But it doesn't fit well if you want to incrementally update
    your dataset in real-time.
  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt>But really, what happens if I INSERT / UPDATE?</dt>
  <dd>What will happen is that your statements will be executed in one of the replicas of the partition
    that was hit, so you will have unconsistent data across partitions. It would be only fine if you
    didn't use replication, but in that case you wouldn't have failover, so it's not something you really
    want to get into.
