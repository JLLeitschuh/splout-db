Splout SQL Change Log
=====================

(DEVELOPMENT 0.3.1-SNAPSHOT)

IMPROVEMENTS

 - 2014-12-12 - No retrying syntax error queries or timeout queries anymore.

 - 2014-12-09 - API accepts user defined partition maps
 - 2014-11-28 - Timeout when pool of DNodes is full. Avoiding enqueue for always queries when Splout is full.
 - 2014-11-12 - QNode connections to DNode retrials are delayed in successive failures.
 - 2014-11-12 - All properties in Splout config starting by hazelcast. are passed through Hazelcast as is.
 - 2014-09-29 - Accepting responses compression with Gzip and deflate

 BUG FIXES

 - 2014-12-05 - TimeoutThread not working properly due to only covering statement prepare.
 - 2014-12-01 - hz.tcp.cluster property only using the first given host
 - 2014-11-28 - Solved a race condition in the TimeoutThread
 - 2014-11-28 - Thrift pools are not in infinite loop to renewal anymore.
 - 2014-11-12 - Upgrading to Hazelcast 3.3.2 that includes many bug fixes.

Splout SQL 0.3.0

IMPROVEMENTS

 - 2014-09-01 - Cloudera CDH5 compilation profile added. Integration test for CDH5 added.
 - 2014-09-01 - Now default profile is mr2. Fixing mr2 integration test
 - 2014-07-31 - Solved a bug that arises when no state was stored in disk
 - 2014-07-23 - Increase GET buffer to 65535
 - 2014-06-02 - Parallel deployment of partitions in DNode, configure through the property dnode.deploy.parallelism. Default 3.
 - 2014-05-20 - Parallel generation of tablespaces with generate command
 - 2014-05-20 - Tablespace tables view in the Splout panel
 - 2014-04-20 - Sampling size can be configured by setting the property  splout.sampling.records.to.sample
                in Hadoop configuration.
 - 2014-02-14 - Improved FULL_SCAN sampling. Now it uses one job per tablespaces instead of
                one per table.
 - 2014-02-14 - Renamed RESERVOIR and DEFAULT sampling methods to FULL_SCAN and RANDOM.
                The default one is now RESERVOIR as it is the one that gives the best results.
 - 2014-02-14 - Sampling is not using memory anymore. That allows to use more samples in
                sampling, so that we can have more accurate partition map.


BUG FIXES

 - 2014-06-30 - Solved a Bug with generated partitions maps. The code could generate partition maps
                with the latest partition empty. Workarround implemented to ensure that all partitions
                has some data.
 - 2014-04-20 - Solved a Bug that prevents the deployment of tablespaces with 128 or more partitions

 - 2013-09-05 - splout-service.sh adapted to run properly with packages from  Cloudera

BUG FIXES

 - 2013-08-01 - SQLiteManager wasn't properly closing all connections opened to SQLite files by different threads, which resulted in a waste of disk space after long-running deployments.
