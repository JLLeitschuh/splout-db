  <dd>There are many Big Data problems whose output is also Big Data. <strong>Splout allows serving an
    arbitrarily big dataset by partitioning it</strong>.

  <dt><img src='img/sploutsql-isotipo-grey.png' width=25/> SQL</dt>
  <dd>There are many databases that allow serving Big Data such as NoSQL solutions, but they don't have a
    <strong>rich query language</strong> like SQL. You generally can't aggregate data in real-time like
    you would do with a GROUP BY clause. Because you can't precompute everything, <strong>SQL is a very
      convenient feature to have</strong> in a Big Data Serving solution.

<dl>
  <dt><img src='img/sploutsql-isotipo-grey.png' width=25/> For Hadoop</dt>
  <dd>Hadoop is nowadays the de-facto open-source solution for Big Data batch-processing. When the output
    of a Hadoop process is big, there isn't a satisfying solution for serving it.
    Think of pre-computed recommendations, for example, where the whole dataset may vary from one day to
    another. <strong>Splout decouples database creation from database serving and makes it efficient and
      safe to deploy Hadoop-generated datasets</strong>. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with common tools
      in the ecosystem such as <strong>Cascading, Hive or Pig</strong>.

<dl>
  <dt><img src='img/sploutsql-isotipo-grey.png' width=25/> Web-latency</dt>
  <dd>Splout is not a "fast analytics" engine. <strong>Splout is made for demanding web or mobile
    applications where query performance is critical</strong>. Arbitrary real-time aggregations should be
    done in less than 200 milliseconds under high traffic load.
  </dd>

<div class="span6">
<dl>
  <dt><img src='img/sploutsql-isotipo-grey.png' width=25/> Scalable</dt>
  <dd><strong>Splout scales horizontally</strong>. By adding more machines you can increase throughput
    linearly. Splout coordinates a cluster of machines to <strong>provide fail-over in case of network
      splits or hardware corruption.</strong></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><img src='img/sploutsql-isotipo-grey.png' width=25/> Flexible</dt>
  <dd>Even though Splout is relational, <strong>it is very flexible</strong>. Because data is deployed
    atomically, <strong>you can change your data model from one day to another without pain</strong>.
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl>
  <dt><img src='img/sploutsql-isotipo-grey.png' width=25/> Easy-to-manage</dt>
  <dd>Splout serves <strong>tablespaces</strong>. Each tablespace may have one or more
    <strong>tables</strong>. Tables are either </strong>partitioned or replicated</strong> in every
    partition. By using </strong>command-line tools</strong> you can index and deploy any dataset in your
    HDFS, local system or remote S3 file system. You can also use the <strong>advanced Java API</strong>
    for fine-tuning the whole process.
