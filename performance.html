  <h2 style="align:center;">Splout's performance</h2>
</div>
<p>Splout has been designed keeping performance and efficiency in mind.</p>

<p>Splout uses <a href='http://www.sqlite.org/'>SQLite</a>, which we have measured to be quite fast with
  big database files.</p>

<p>In the early development stages we compared SQLite to MySQL in an Amazon m1.large instance using a
  20GB database. We performed uniformly random GROUP BY queries over a dataset whose group distribution
  was based on a zipfian. These are the results we obtained for different number of concurrent
  threads:</p>

<p>We have also compared Splout to Voldemort in order to demonstrate that Splout can also behave well as
  a Key/Value store in addition to provide full SQL richness. We did so in a physical machine with the
  following characteristics: 4G RAM, quad core 1.6 MHz, HD 75 MB/Sg (73 seeks/sg). The database had
  60000000 rows with values of 1024 bytes size. We executed 10000 uniformly random queries in three
  iterations.</p>
